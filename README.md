# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose is well defined (2 pt) The purpose of this webpage is to display the data set of UFO sightings in the form of a table with filtering abilities. The table is dynamic and can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.


In this module, you'll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. You'll also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
You'll customize your webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Watch the video to learn more about the specific data project you'll be working on.

## Results

To the left of the table is a filter search box. There you can enter a date, city, state, country, or shape and the table will update when a character is present and enter is pressed. Below are two examples of how searched for El Cajon, CA and KY are displayed.


Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

A drawback to the webpage is the filter can only look at one id at a time. For example you cannot look at the state of California and Kentucky at the same time.

Drop down menu where you can pick multiple criteria would eliminate this drawback. Also the ability to sort the table by more recent or least recent would improve
user experience.
