# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this module is to help Dana build a table using UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array. We will also add fully functional filters that will take the date, city, state, country and shape the user will enter. This will make the table fully dynamic and will allow the user to interact with the entire webpage.

### resources
* Visual Studio code
  - Html / css / Bootstrap / javaScript ES6
## Results

The filters have been added to the left of the table and this allows users to filter the data according to several criteria: date, city, state, country and shape. The screenshots below show that the data in the table changes depending on the user input.

## Summary
One of the drawbacks is that you canâ€™t use two or three filters at a time, for example.
We have to filter one by one.

recommendations:

As a solution to the problem mentioned above, we will need to refactor the app.js code to make the filters work at the same time.

In addition, we will need to add a dropdown menu to a nav bar at the top of the page to make the webpage more dynamic and also add
the user validation like username and password to protect our webpage.
